# Welcome!

This tutorial is currently being built. It should be finished by November 1st. Don't hesitate to comment to help me build it

## Our mission

**Our goal is to empower developers, no matter their educational or professional background, to learn from their peers, level up their skills and showcase their talent.**

_Disclaimer: Except for the content created by the community in the **Learn** section, CodinGame doesn't provide any tutorial to learn the basics of programming from scratch. We highly recommend taking a tutorial online to learn these basics before heading to the **Practice** section and trying to solve coding puzzles._

On CodinGame, you'll be able to:

- practice your programming skills and learn new ones
- find a job and practice programming interviews
- code for fun and chill
- hang out with other passionate coders
- strengthen your confidence and motivation to code

Welcome!

## Standard streams

In computer programming, standard streams are preconnected input and output communication channels between a computer program and its environment when it begins execution. The three input/output (I/O) connections are called standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr).

CodinGame's model is to communicate with text, via these streams: your program is given inputs, the data needed to solve the problem, in the stdin and you need to print out the requested answer in the stdout.
Hence, one of our taglines being: "Read stdin, Flush stdout"

### Protocol

The default code, given in all CodinGame puzzles, already parses the inputs in stdin, does nothing with them and prints a default output in the stdout.

You can find more details about this default code and what to expect from the inputs and how to format your answer at the bottom of any puzzle statement.

### Debugging

You can use the stderr for debug purposes. Debug messages will show in the console output (at the bottom left).

You can not use breakpoints.
